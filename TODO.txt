TODO List for this app:

Shortlist:
:) Accept track nicknames, ignores (Text) at end of albums
- End of song calculator/timer/stopwatch

Core functionality:
- Next song calculations
- Page Progression (not all on new.html)
- View/Select Personal Playlists after  (use css flex for display)
- Submit a Playlist link
- Shuffle & Play <x> songs
:/ Auto-update Album Cover, song information
    --> not perfect, but kinda works (only on "next song" click")

Goals:
- Reveal Answer button!
- remove answers at top. maybe have debug mode?
- Function that focuses unanswered fields
- Replace breaks with css spacing/padding
- Track Progression Bar, timer
- Accent Background Colors based on album cover
- Results page
- String Standardization/Cleaning (i.e. remove "(Deluxe)" from album names)
- Handle Special Characters
- Quiz again?
- Support guessing ALL artists for songs with multiple artists *Probably very difficult
- Presentable Front End Theme
- Determine if song should automatically play when starts on web browser

Bugs/Improvement:
- Doesn't load album cover unless spotify is previously playing on another device
- Promise for next song/update song THEN unlock fields
- If "next song" selected while paused, will play automatically. Button SHOULD display "PAUSE" but doesn't
- If song is updated externally, song display doesn't update
- If song ends, next song plays automatically and song does not update
:( let song = data.item.name; => Sometimes undefined??
    --> Thought fixed,  but it isn't. Within update track function that has its own call


Other ideas:
- Parcels => enable hot modulation (tool)
- Reducts/React.js
- swap to vscode
