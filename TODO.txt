TODO List for this app:

Shortlist:
- playlist link support
- use cookies/local storage
- single as answer for single releases AND/OR album lookups

Core functionality:
- Page Progression (not all on new.html)
- View/Select Personal Playlists after  (use css flex for display)
- Submit a Playlist link
- Shuffle & Play <x> songs

Answer formatting:
- Hemming Distance for awkward song spelling (i.e. worst nites => worst nights)
:) String Standardization/Cleaning (i.e. remove "(Deluxe)" from album names) => Improvement item added
:) Handle Special Characters => Improvement item added

Goals:
- Reveal Answer button!
- Disable pausing from browser? maybe not necessary
- remove answers at top. maybe have debug mode?
- Function that focuses unanswered fields
- Replace breaks with css spacing/padding
- Track Progression Bar, timer
- Accent Background Colors based on album cover
- Results page
- Quiz again?
- Support guessing ALL artists for songs with multiple artists *Probably very difficult
- Presentable Front End Theme
- Determine if song should automatically play when starts on web browser
- Less hacky special character substitution
- Prepare next song in que for seamless album/info updates.

Bugs/Improvement:
- Album lookups for singles, and for expansion albums
:) awaits using "send_simple_request" aren't true promises. sends request, doesn't wait for response.
- Verify "tag_text" in clean_album name is excessive
- if by some chance the same song plays twice in a row, I do not believe the song updates properly. does not on click. maybe use ID for this?
    => should only schedule update on a TRUE pause
- Flickery album updates => multiple updates occurring? Random flickers throughout song? => Multiple update timers set.
:) Doesn't load album cover on startup unless spotify is previously playing on another device? Now not at all?
- If "next song" selected while paused, will play automatically. Button SHOULD display "PAUSE" but doesn't
- Consider: Pause after end of song => manual continues OR repeat song
:) let song = data.item.name; => Sometimes undefined??
    --> Thought fixed,  but it isn't. Within update track function that has its own call
    --> I BELIEVE if we fix initial song behavior, this will be fixed
- Update song state event gives like 3 alerts => Detect which are pauses, resumes, skips, etc. behave appropriately.
    --> Appears to be down to 2
- Remove excessive console logs. Improve logging content quality.

Other ideas:
- Parcels => enable hot modulation (tool)
- Reducts/React.js
- swap to vscode
