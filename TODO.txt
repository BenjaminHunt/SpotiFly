TODO List for this app:

Core functionality:
- Remove Ajax Sync Behavior. Replace with await/promises/then solution
- Play on Web Page Automatically
- Next song calculations

- Page Progression (not all on new.html)
- View/Select Personal Playlists after Auth
- Submit a Playlist link
- Shuffle & Play <x> songs
- Auto-update Album Cover, song information
- Blur Album Cover
- Unblur after correct guesses
- Lock Field after correct guess
:) Button to continue to next song
- Disable Autoplay?
:) Clear inputs/guess-status on new song
- Unlock inputs on New Song

Goals:
- Replace breaks with css spacing/padding
- Track Progression Bar, timer
- Accent Background Colors based on album cover
- Results page
- String Standardization/Cleaning (i.e. remove "(Deluxe)" from album names)
- Handle Special Characters
- Quiz again?
- Support guessing ALL artists for songs with multiple artists *Probably very difficult
- Presentable Front End Theme

Bugs:
- If "next song" selected while paused, will play automatically. Button SHOULD display "PAUSE" but doesn't
- If song is updated externally, song display doesn't update
- If song ends, next song plays automatically and song does not update
- Song updates too late when played on web page (when "next song" clicked, doesn't update until clicked again)
    --> Temporary Fix: Pinging API 3 times appears to update it correctly
- General async behavior/characteristics
