TODO List for this app:

Core functionality:
- Remove Ajax Sync Behavior. Replace with await/promises/then solution
- Play on Web Page Automatically
- Next song calculations

- Page Progression (not all on new.html)
- View/Select Personal Playlists after Auth
- Submit a Playlist link
- Shuffle & Play <x> songs
:/ Auto-update Album Cover, song information
    --> not perfect, but kinda works (only on "next song" click")
- Blur Album Cover
- Unblur after correct guesses
:) Lock Field after correct guess
:) Button to continue to next song
- Disable Autoplay?
:) Clear inputs/guess-status on new song
:) Unlock inputs on New Song

Goals:
- Function that focuses unanswered fields
- Replace breaks with css spacing/padding
- Track Progression Bar, timer
- Accent Background Colors based on album cover
- Results page
- String Standardization/Cleaning (i.e. remove "(Deluxe)" from album names)
- Handle Special Characters
- Quiz again?
- Support guessing ALL artists for songs with multiple artists *Probably very difficult
- Presentable Front End Theme
- Determine if song should automatically play when starts on web browser

Bugs:
- If "next song" selected while paused, will play automatically. Button SHOULD display "PAUSE" but doesn't
- If song is updated externally, song display doesn't update
- If song ends, next song plays automatically and song does not update
- Song updates too late when played on web page (when "next song" clicked, doesn't update until clicked again)
- General async behavior/characteristics
    --> Temporary patch: wait functions
- let song = data.item.name; => Sometimes undefined??
