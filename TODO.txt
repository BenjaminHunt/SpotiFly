TODO List for this app:

Shortlist:
- use cookies/local storage
- single as answer for single releases AND/OR album lookups

Core functionality:
- Page Progression (not all on new.html)
- View/Select Personal Playlists after  (use css flex for display)
- Play <x> songs

Goals:
- Function that focuses unanswered fields
- Replace breaks with css spacing/padding
- Track Progression Bar, timer
- Accent Background Colors based on album cover
- Results page
- Quiz again?
- Support guessing ALL artists for songs with multiple artists *Probably very difficult
- Presentable Front End Theme
- Determine if song should automatically play when starts on web browser
- Less hacky special character substitution
- Hemming Distance for awkward song spelling (i.e. worst nites => worst nights)

Bugs/Improvement:
- Refactor page names
- Album lookups for singles, and for expansion albums
- Verify "tag_text" in clean_album name is excessive
- Consider: Pause after end of song => manual continues OR repeat song


Other ideas:
- Parcels => enable hot modulation (tool)
- Reducts/React.js
- swap to vscode
