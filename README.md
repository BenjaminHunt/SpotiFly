This will be a song information guessing game.

This will allow users to sign in with Spotify's Implicit Authentication Flow, select a playlist, and give them an opportunity to test their knowledge on their favorite songs by guessing the song's name, artist, and album.

### Start Player
1. run `py -m http.server` from the root repository
2. visit `localhost:8000/new.html` in a web browser (**Note:** I am currently only using Google Chrome)
